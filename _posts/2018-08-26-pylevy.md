[Pylevy](https://github.com/josemiotto/pylevy) is a python package for fast calculation of the PDF and CDF of the 
[LÃ©vy Stable distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_distribution).
It also contains a routine to fit the distribution to data.

I published the package a couple of years ago, adapting a previous package developed by Paul Harrison. 
The PDF of the Stable distribution is not explicit, but has to be calculated from the definition, inverting its 
Fourier transform.
The trick is to save those calculated PDFs for a grid of parameters and interpolate them if a parameter is 
not exactly a value in the grid. The tail of the distribution is computed through a power-law approximation. 
The speed-up in the calculation is needed in order to fit the distribution: the Likelihood function is optimized 
numerically, so the PDF needs to be called multiple times.

Some bugs were reported, so I managed to fix them, after a long time of inactivity. I also updated the documentation, 
and I created a minimal [website for it](https://pylevy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) at readthedocs.org (
[this post](https://www.pythonforthelab.com/blog/documenting-with-sphinx-and-readthedocs/) was very helpful for that).
